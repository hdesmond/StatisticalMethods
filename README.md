### Course Objectives

The course is intended to provide an introduction to modern
statistical methodology and its applications to problems in
astrophysics and cosmology.  The course is aimed at graduate students
intending to do research in astrophysics and cosmology, and we
strongly encourage most first and second year students working in
KIPAC to take the course.  Our goal is to provide a background that
will be directly relevant to the kind of problems that typical KIPAC
students will encounter in their research.
